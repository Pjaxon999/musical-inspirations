    <h1>My Musical Inspirations</h1>

<h2>A Short Explanation</h2>
<p>
    Before I begin, I want to make sure that the meaning of inspiration is properly understood in this context.
    Many people associate inspiration in a musical context to essentially mean, "These are the artists I want to sound like."
    I'd like to stress that when I am using the word inspiration, I take it to mean, "Artists that make me
    want to create something." This should help explain some otherwise confusing inclusions.
</p>
<h2>1. Plini</h2>
<img class="heading-image" src="./assets/images/plini 2.jpg" alt="The Guitarist and composer Plini playing a live show surrounded by lights.">
<p>
    Plini makes me want to be better at making music. His ability to create incredibly emotive and passionate melodic lines
    on the guitar is incredible. The way that he is able to layer sounds to reinforce different elements in his music is also
    phenomenal. I also appreciate how he will weave in a bit of good old fashioned metal into his compositions every now and then.
    It helps add a unique flavor of dynamics that I think sets him apart from other makers of what is often called "music for guitarists."
    But in my opinion, his best quality is being able to weave basic chord progressions, melodies, and harmonies into complex rhythmic
    contexts to create a relatable but unmistakeably progressive sound.
</p>
<h2>2. Devin Townsend</h2>

<p>
    I must admit that I only truly love a few of Devin's songs, but I none the less find him a massively inspirational figure. When I
    think about what I want to accomplish musically, his name always comes to mind. Creatively, his ability to be open and
    honest with himself about what he is creating and why is extremely important to me. He writes songs that are complete visions
    crafted piece by piece. Sometimes these songs can be meticulously woven together, and other times they are seemly tossed together
    haphazardly, but the end result is unmistakeably Devin Townsend. I wish I had the same musical courage Devin has to put out songs 
    like Kingdom, Deadhead, and Stormbending which are all incredible full pieces of music but then turn around and do a record like 
    Powernerd which is a self-described pisstake. 
</p>
<h2>3. Thrice</h2>
<img class="heading-image" src="./assets/images/Thrice 2.jpg" alt="Thrice playing a live show. The lights behind them are strong and make them look like silhouettes.">
<p>
    Thrice is a band that I both grew up with and also grew into. They, along with Deftones, were probably the first heavy band that I
    really got into. But I think with the release of The Alchemy Index parts 1-4, I found an even greater and new appreciation for them.
    Of course, many artists over the years have done concept albums, and I would be the first to admit that in many cases, The Alchemy Index
    does tend to be a bit on the nose. But the reality is that it was the right album for young me at the time to start becoming much more
    open to different types of sounds and influences. Thrice as a band makes me want to be able to approach these different sounds and styles
    myself with the same openness that they displayed whilst making that project. I also think that in terms of writing, I have always
    appreciated both Dustin's vocals and Teppei's parts, even if lyrically I am not always on board.
</p>
<h2>4. Tony McManus</h2>

<p>
    I will be the first to admit that I am not much of an acoustic guitar player. My experience playing acoustic is mostly cenetered around
    strumming big simple chords and trying not to embarass myself too much while I sing. While Tony is obviously an incredible acoustic player,
    I find him inspirational for two very specific reasons. First, his capacity for arrangement is incredible. Listening to his renditions of
    pieces written for other instruments demonstrates that he understands both the strenghts and weaknesses of the guitar, but also has a great
    understanding of how the original pieces are constructed. Secondly, I will always love that he is so unapologetically himself. He's just a
    straightforward musician who kicks ass at guitar who just so happens to enjoy lots of Celtic music. I strive to be as creative and self-assured
    as he seems to be.
</p>
<h2>5. Guthrie Govan</h2>

<p>
    We all wish we could be as good as Guthrie, but we probably can't. That may not seem particularly inspirational, but I think about it differently.
    I think it is nice that there are people out there who can push guitar sounds and techniques further and further.
    It means that there is an ever moving boundary to what my instrument of choice can do sonically, and Guthrie is someone who is both able
    to express that virtuosity but also not take himself too seriously. Someone who could play the solo to Fives but also find the hilarity and
    joy in randomly breaking out the inspector gadget theme accidentally during a jazz jam is a force to be reckoned with. If I could ever
    forcibly take lessons from one man, it would be him.
</p>
<h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>
<img class="main-image" src="./assets/images/pexels-rdne-7468243.jpg" alt="a series of 3 medals to represent my 3 honorable mentions. They are glowing bright and gold, with some multi colored bands.">
<h3>TesseracT</h3>
<p>
    If I could have Jay Postones and Amos Williams permanently in my bands' rhythm section, I would be unstoppable. Dan Wilkins is easily a top 3
    vocalist in the genre. The band inspires me to write more rhythmically complex parts that still have a strong pulse behind them with a nice 
    leading melody layered atop it all. 
</p>
<h3>Adam 'Nolly' Getgood</h3>
<p>
    I could have probably just put Periphery in here, but I think that wouldn't be fair. Nolly's approach to production, mixing, and mastering needs to
    be singled out as particularly inspirational. Plus he has worked with both Plini and Devin Townsend previously which earns him lots of bonus points.
</p>
<h3>Ben Levin</h3>
<p>
    Ben's music is not for me. But his creative output as a content creator is on a completely different level. He has both a complete course on basic music
    theory for guitarists as well as avant garde video pieces about existential dread. I will always respect the fact that he is willing to show the warts of
    his creative process. It inspires me to be more accepting of my own creations, and his videos always have good information that has helped me create more
    as well.
